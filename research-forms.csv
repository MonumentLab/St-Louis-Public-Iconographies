As a teenager my church youth group would go to the Fun Park on the corners of Lindbergh and Taylor off of 270 (now a car lot). Fancy dinners were had at the Top of the Tower on Chambers or Noah's Ark in St. Charles. Dinner after church was at Ozella's (spelled wrong) on 36 or Cusumano's in Glasglow Village.
